1. If you get warnings only then add error_reporting(E_PARSE); in index.php in zip to avoid warnings on DirectAdmin.
2. The language packs are available in the package /system/languages folder. Language is not available in 3.3 so we have removed it. 
3. Cache settings "Filesystem Storage". (doesn't ask anything like this in v3.4. check in next version if it ask about it)
