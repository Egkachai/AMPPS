================================================================== 
 SECURITY RELEASE UPDATE:
 Two very minor security issues were discovered in Crafty Syntax Live
 Help. The Patch for both of these is detailed below. Both of these 
 security issues are VERY MINOR. The admin.php can 
 not be accessed by the public so the remote file vulnerabiy can
 only be exploited by operators which makes it very hard to exploit.
 Additonally it is not executed code so not remote code can be run on 
 the server. 
 The full path disclosure allows hackers to see the full path
 to your installation but nothing more. This has been fixed as well.
