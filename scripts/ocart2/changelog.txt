2.0.0.0

We're happy to announce our latest version, 2.0!

New features include:
Fully responsive design
OCmod - virtual file modification
Redesigned admin area and front end
More payment gateways included in the standard download
Event notification system
Custom form fields

Although 2.0 is now released we advise all existing store owners to check that any 3rd party modules they have installed will work with the latest version. If you already have a working store we always advise a backup is done and you test in a new environment before you update!
