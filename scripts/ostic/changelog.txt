needs. Users can register for accounts via the client portal and can now
login with a username and password instead of email and ticket number. We
also have a forgot-my-password link and several other new minor adjustments
to the user profile.

### External Authentication Support
Use third-party SSO to authenticate your users and staff. Initial support
include OAuth2 and LDAP (v0.5 of the LDAP plugin is required)

### User Directory
Search, view, and manage, even delete! contact information from the users
from whom you receive tickets. Staff can also manually register users and
even set an initial password. Users can also be imported and exported via
CSV data.

### Organizations
Organize your users together into organizations. Organizations can have
internal owners ("Account Manager") and external owners ("Primary Contact").
The Account Manager can receive new ticket and new message alerts.
Organization Primary Contacts and members can be automatically added to
tickets as collaborators.

### User and Organization Notes
Quickly view, edit, add and remove pertinent notes on your users and
organizations

### Form Management
Staff members can now add, delete, and sort forms attached to tickets, users
and organizations as well as remove stale data where fields have been
retired from active forms.

### Custom Properties for Lists
Add properties to your list items and use it in your email templates and
pages. For example create an address property to a list of locations. List
items can also be disabled now, which causes them to be hidden from
selection.

### PJAX page loading
For browsers supporting PJAX, navigating around the system will see a
performance improvement as javascript and css files are not re-parsed for
each page load.
