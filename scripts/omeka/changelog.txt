Release Notes for 2.2

New Features

Shortcodes

    Omeka now supports shortcodes for embedding content such as a list of recent or featured items, as well as plugin content, such as a map from the Geolocation plugin.
    The new Simple Pages plugin bundled with Omeka supports shortcodes in the page text. 

Derivative Images

    Configurable and extensible derivative image (thumbnail) creation
    Blacklisting and whitelisting image creation by MIME type in config.ini
    Support for using ext/imagick instead of command-line ImageMagick
    The default ImageMagick derivative creator no longer separately tries to run identify; this can double thumbnail creation speed for some files 

Representative Files for Records

    Any record type can return a "representative" file Omeka can use for displaying thumbnails
    Collections and Exhibits select a representative image for themselves and so will show thumbnails on the front page, their browse pages, and in shortcodes
    Items, Files, Collections, Exhibits, and any other records with representative images will show thumbnails on sitewide search results 

Appearance

    Admins can hide the header listing the element set ("Dublin Core") on item/collection/file pages through Appearance Settings
    Additional fallback thumbnail icons for audio, video, and image types
    Sorting links on the default public collections browse view
    Common "single.php" themeable display for Items, Collections, and Exhibits used in recent and featured sections and shortcodes
    Dev-editable button text for items-specific search 

Admin Interface

    New interface for manually resending the user activation email message to a user.
    The user edit page is split among three subpages and more closely follows the admin style
    The Item-specific advanced search page more closely follows the admin style
    The File edit page has tabs for each element set and filter-added section, like the Item and Collection add/edit pages
    The dropdown for selecting a Collection for an item is sorted alphabetically by collection title
    HTML edit boxes for metadata will automatically grow with the text input 

Security

    Admins can now specify more Allowed HTML Elements, such as iframe
    Ability to enable or disable element filtering for the API 

Other

    Username restrictions greatly relaxed to allow email addresses as usernames
    Theme configuration can now be divided into named sections
    Accessibility improvements throughout the admin and public themes
    jQuery and jQuery UI now automatically fall back to local copies if the CDN copy can't be loaded
    All records can be sorted randomly
    Search term input on "Narrow by Specific Fields" disables for "is empty" and "is not empty" types
    Files can be internally filtered by original filename (#616, thanks to Daniel Berthereau)
    Simple "OR" searches on records by providing an array of values (#622, thanks to Daniel Berthereau) 

Bugs Fixed

    MIME types could be incorrectly set for multiple files uploaded simultaneously
    HTML in titles shown incorrectly on batch-edit
    Invalid XML characters could break omeka-xml and omeka-json output (#617, thanks to Rachel Donahue)
    Emails sent by Omeka did not support non-Latin characters (#618, thanks to Marios Bekatoros)
    Element names were not localized on items/browse listing of filters (#620, thanks to Matti Lassila)
    On the item-specific advanced search, "does not contain" did not include items that completely omitted the element (#621, thanks to Daniel Berthereau
