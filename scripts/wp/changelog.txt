    EP_ALL_ARCHIVES [24812] 
	
WordPress 3.6.1 is a maintenance release which addresses 13 bugs with version 3.6.

1) Additionally: Version 3.6.1 fixes three security issues:

- Remote Code Execution: Block unsafe PHP de-serialization that could occur in limited situations and setups, which can lead to remote code execution. Reported by Tom Van Goethem. CVE-2013-4338.
- Link Injection / Open Redirect: Fix insufficient input validation that could result in redirecting or leading a user to another website. Reported by Dave Cummo, a Northrup Grumman subcontractor for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CVE-2013-4339.
- Privilege Escalation: Prevent a user with an Author role, using a specially crafted request, from being able to create a post "written by" another user. Reported by Anakorn Kyavatanakij. CVE-2013-4340. 

2) Additional security hardening:
- Updated security restrictions around file uploads to mitigate the potential for cross-site scripting. The extensions .swf and .exe are no longer allowed by default, and .htm and .html are only allowed if the user has the ability to use unfiltered HTML.
