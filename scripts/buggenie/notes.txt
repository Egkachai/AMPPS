1. Add an index.php in the package from the old package. It is just a file to redirect to the /buggenie folder.
2. Make script where Database ENGINE is InnoDB
3. We have tested since 3.2.4 (lowest version of 3.2.x) and there is no upgrade necessary and updates is available only for versions 3.2+, so when there is database change in future please make changes in upgrade and check auto upgrade properly
