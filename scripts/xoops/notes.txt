1) Put Upgrade folder in the ZIP Package
2) xoops_data and xoops_lib go in data.zip
3) In Upgrade.php we have written code for version 2.5.0 (for not to show the upgrade link)
4) We have added fix in Upgrade/upd-2.4.0-to-2.4.1 index.php. Replaced $checkbit with $func. check if upgrade works without this fix in next version
   (4th step is not required from version 2.5.7. It works fine from 2.5.7)
